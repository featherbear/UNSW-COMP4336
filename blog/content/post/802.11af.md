## Over-the-Air Television Channels

* TV Channels - VHF and UHF --> ~300 MHz
* Each channels use 6-8 MHz (depending on country)
* *Analogue channels need to be separated by at least one channel width as to avoid interference

## Digital Television

* Does not need empty channels between neighbours
* Require about 19 Mbps -> Can transmit 6-8 channels in 6-8 MHz

# 802.11af-2014 - White-Fi

White-Fi uses the free/whitespace of the 700 MHz spectrum for WiFi usage

## Software Defined Radio

Radios that can digitally reproduce different modes of radio.

Uses a DSP or FPGA.

Flexible, upgradable, cheaper, lower power consumption

* Software Defined Antenna - small pixel elements configurable by software for the desired band

* Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)
  * These chips / circuit boards exist but are not widely available

## TV White Space (TVWS)

_(The free/unused channels)_

10 companies are authorised by the FCC to administer the TVWS database.

These companies can fetch data, register devices, synchronise databases and ultimately provide channel availability to devices

## 802.11af Database Operation

* GDB - Geolocation Database
* RLSS - Registered Location Secure Service
  * Provides faster response to access points locally in a campus
  * May be owned by the ISP
* GDD - Geolocation Data Dependent
  * GDD Enabling - Access points
  * GDD Dependent - Other stations

* PAWS protocol to access

<!-- ## Registered Location Query Protocol (RLQP)

Protocol for exchange of white space map (WSM) among RLSS, APs, and stations, aka, Channel Schedule Management (CSM)

* CSM Request: APs ask other APs or RLSS about white space map
* APs broadcast beacons on all channels selected.
* Stations associate with the APs.
* Contact Verification Signal (CVS): APs tell their stations white space map and confirm that stations are still associated
* Contact Availability Query (CAQ): Stations ask AP, if they do not receive the map within a timeout interval
* CAQ Response
* Network Channel Control (NCC) Request: Sent by stations to APs requesting use of a channel. AP may forward to RLSS.
* NCC Response: Permission to transmit on requested channel qStations may be disassociated by APs if necessary -->

> 700 MHz

Basic Channel Unit (BCU) - BCU - One TV Channel

* $ W = 6 MHz $ in the USA

## Channel Bonding

* Contiguous - 2W
* Non-contiguous - W+W, 2W+2W

## OFDM Data Rates

![](2020-07-01_10-19-21.png)

* Max 256-QAM 
* Max 5/6 Coding
* OFDM similar to 40 MHz in 802.11 but downclocked by 7.5x
  * 0.4μs GI in 802.11n -> 3μs in 802.11af (0.4x7.5=3)
  * 3.2μs data interval -> 3.2x7.5 = 24μs
  * Total symbol interval = 24 + 3 = 27μs
* 6MHz channel: 144 total subcarriers
  * 108 Data
  * 3 DC
  * 6 pilots
  * 36 guard
* Data rate (single stream single channel) - 26.67 Mbps
* Max data rate (4 streams, 4 channels) - 26.67 * 4 * 4 = 426.7 Mbps
