# Quiz 1

## 1

Input signal = 1W  
Input signal = 10 log(1000 mW) = 30 dBm

Received signal has a 20 dBm loss.  
Received signal = 30 dBm - 20 dBm = 10 dBm

Noise level level of 1 mW  
1 mW = 0 dBm

Signal to Noise = 10 dBm - 0 dBm = 10 dBm  

## 2

Max data rate for a 10 MHz noiseless channel, using 8 level digital signals.  

2 * 10 * 10^6 * log_2 8  
= 60 * 10^2

## 3

SNR to get 10 Mbps through a 5 MHz channel.  

10 * 10^6 = 5 * 10^6 * log_2 {1 + S/N}

2 = log {1 + S/N}  
1 + S/N = 2^2 = 4  
S/N = 3  
10log(3) = 4.77 dB
