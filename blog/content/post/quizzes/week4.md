> 802.11a-1999 supports 8 data rates, ranging from 6 Mbps to 54 Mbps. What data rate could be achieved if 256 QAM was used with a coding rate of 5/6?

a. 100 Mbps  
b. 125 Mbps  
c. 175 Mbps  
d. 150 Mbps  
**e. 80 Mbps**   



---

> 802.11ax achieves higher data rates compared to its predecessor, 802.11ac, by further shortening the guard interval. 

**False**

---

> 802.11ax uses wider subcarriers compared to 802.11ac.

**False**

---

> A WLAN standard is employing a spread spectrum coding, which produces chips at a rate of 1 chip per two cycles (two Hz). It uses 8 chips to code a symbol. To achieve a data rate of 11 Mbps for a 22 MHz channel, what level/order of QAM is needed to modulate the signal?

a. 64-QAM  
b. 16-QAM  
c. 128-QAM  
d. 32-QAM  
**e. 256-QAM**

---

> An access point with 8 antennas can theoretically transmit 8 times more information to a single antenna device

**True**

---

> Which of the following WiFi flavours has more than two options for selecting its guard interval?

**a. 802.11ax**  
b. 802.11ac  
c. None of these  
d. 802.11a  
e. 802.11n  

---

> Which of the following WiFi would allow multiple mobile clients to communicate with the access point simultaneously?

**a. 802.11ax**  
b. 802.11n  
c. None of these  
d. 802.11a  
e. 802.11ac   

---

> What could be the maximum achievable data rate for 802.11n if it were allowed to use a 128-QAM?

a. 750Mbps  
b. 1.2Gbps  
c. 650Mbps  
**d. 700Mbps**  
e. 1Gbps  


---

> Which WiFi has the lowest symbol rate?

a. 802.11b  
b. 802.11ac  
**c. 802.11ax**  
d. 802.11a  
e. 802.11n  

---

> The original OFDM for 802.11a-1999 has a 3200ns data pulse, but the effective symbol interval is extended by another 800 ns guard interval (GI) to cater for multi-path delay spread. If a low-spread environment reduces the GI by half, what will be the increase in symbol rate?

a. About 50%  
b. About 5%  
c. About 100%  
**d. About 12%**  
e. None of these
