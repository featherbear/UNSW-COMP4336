Select one:  
a. 30  
b. 15  
**c. 26**  
d. 20

> By executing the beam refinement protocol (BRP), a pair of devices can widen the beam that was selected by the sector level sweep (SLS).

Select one:  
True  
**False**   

---

> During Beacon Time (BT), all non-AP stations have their antennas configured as directional.

Select one:  
True  
**False**   

---

> To cover all directions (360 degrees), an 802.11ad PCP/AP employs two 10-sector antennas. Each antenna sector covers 18 degrees. During a Beacon Time (BT), how many beacons the AP should transmit?

Select one:  
a. 18  
b. 10  
**c. 20**  
d. 38  
e. 2  

<!-- Each antenna has a different beacon transmitted -->

> PHY-A uses a guard interval (GI) of 400 ns to combat inter-symbol interference. PHY-B is derived by down clocking PHY-A by a factor of 5. What is the length of GI used by PHY-B?

Select one:  
**a. 2 microsec**  
b. 80 nanosec  
c. 2 millisec  
d. 2 nanosec  
e. 0.2 microsec

> IEEE 802.11af would be suitable for rural areas because it uses TV signals, which can travel long distance.

Select one:  
**True**  
False

> In Example 4 (Slide 70, Week-5 lecture notes), the outcome of the SLS is the beam pair (3,1). For what range of RSS values recorded at the responder for the frame transmitted by the first antenna sector in A would lead to (1,1) as the SLS outcome?

Select one:  
a. RSS greater than -50dBm  
b. RSS smaller than -50dBm  
c. RSS smaller than -64dBm  
d. RSS greater than -64dBm  
**e. RSS greater than 50dBm**

> In IEEE 802.11ad, BRP precedes SLS.

Select one:  
True  
**False**   

---

> If two 802.11ad devices have 64 antenna sectors each, searching the best sector pair using omnidirectional approach can reduce the total number of training frame transmissions, compared to the exhaustive search, by

a. 4096 transmissions  
b. 4064 transmissions  
c. 64 transmissions  
d. 4032 transmissions  
**e. 3968 transmissions**

> 802.11ay achieves higher speed compared to 802.11ad at the expense of shorter communication range.

Select one:  
True  
**False**
